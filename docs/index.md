    **Automaton** - noun `/ɔːˈtɒmət(ə)n/`
    *a self-operating machine, or a machine or control mechanism designed to automatically follow a predetermined sequence of operations, or respond to predetermined instructions.*

## What is Automaton?

Automaton is first and foremost a powerful toy for developers. Our ambitious goal is to empower developers, so they can research, design, build, test and deploy their own scalable peer-to-peer protocols, communication standards and decentralized applications (dApps).

## What are we doing?

We are building tools that allow for permissionless innovation in the blockchain space that will challenge the centralized status quo, which is critical in restoring the liberty of individuals to own and freely utilize their own personal information.

The first tool is the Automaton Core - the blockchain toy for developers. Automaton Core is a command line tool allowing developers to design, setup, test and launch their own network protocols and consensus mechanisms.

The second and most important tool will be the Automaton Playground - the blockchain toy not just for developers, but for everyone. We envision a GUI based tool built on top of Automaton Core, that will not only provide templates for well known peer-to-peer network architectures, but also allow people to utilize the building blocks to visually design their own architecture from scratch.

We are designing an open and scalable platform - a network of networks, in which anyone can register their own network and have it interact freely with other networks. Participants can contribute their work as formally specified building blocks, which can then be used by others to produce even greater results. Building blocks can then not only be improved upon but can be combined in order create complex protocols on top of them. By having formal protocol specifications, Automaton networks will allow for cross-network operability by design.

Essentially, we are building a crypto LEGOLAND for decentralized peer-to-peer networks, where anyone can play with the LEGO pieces and build whatever they want, including custom made LEGO pieces.

## Why are we doing it?

Blockchain projects are usually governed by their core developers. These projects usually solve one problem really well...in isolation. Merging all the innovation across projects is a non-trivial technical problem, which stems from the fact that most protocols lack formal specification and are incompatible when it comes to scalability and consensus mechanisms.

In a peer-to-peer network, the protocol is the network’s constitution. A Smart Protocol is a self-governed network’s constitution.

## Who will benefit from it?

- Developers looking to build interoperable network protocols, which adhere to a standard specification.
- Software architects who wish to create their protocols with interoperability across networks.
- Project founders that need a quick way to set up a project and stakeholders with roles, rights and responsibilities, and more importantly track participation and progress in real-time.
- Researchers and academics that need a laboratory in which they can run experiments and publish scientific study results. For example new one-way hash functions, signature schemes, consensus algorithms, etc.
- End users who want to participate in a decentralized network, where their voices are heard and accounted for.
- Enterprises that need a custom, scalable database with built-in accountability and transparency.

## How could we make people's life easier?

In Automaton, participants are not encumbered with additional cost, bandwidth and storage overhead from protocols and dApps they are not using, which is a direct advantage to not using a traditional, all encompassing blockchain.

Paperwork and audit trail cost reduction for large organizations and government institutions. Governments could literally just define the rules, set it and forget it.

Client side encryption based dApps will be able to secure the private information of individuals so that they have the ability to only share it on a need-to-know basis. Third parties should only be able to view the information that the protocol designers and users permit them access to.

Streamline and simplify the process of organizing from simple projects to complex governance. Stakeholders can start a project with a partnership of two, and have the ability to scale it on the same network to the government of a nation. 

Through the standardization of open protocols across networks users will gain the freedom to choose service providers based on open market competition. This frees users from the current state of service provider lock-in that has monopolized most of the Internet communications business and stifled competition.

Users will be able to transfer value across the network at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional methods.

## How are we standing out?
No ICO. We are looking for collaborators, not speculators.

We introduce Smart Protocols, which evolve beyond the concept of Smart Contracts, by decentralizing the process of publishing and launching new network protocols.

Standardization of open protocols to allow industry wide competition of digital services.

Starting with the Playground, we are releasing usable tools first, which enable innovators to create value for all network participants.

A novel concept makes centralized mining pools obsolete, so that anyone who wishes to secure the network can become a miner or a validator without the need to purchase specialized hardware.

We are not building the end-all solution to these problems. We are building the environment where these solutions can be fostered.
